# Scrabble_helper
# Python program to find all possible words with given letters. Polish version

# This program allows you to see all the possible words that you can create from given letters (max 8 letters) 
with points for each word, according to official Scrabble letter values.

# Type all lowercase letters. 
# Start your input with uppercase letter to find only words, that start with this letter.
# Put last input letter in uppercase to find only words, that ends with this letter.

# Use * for a blank tile, which means that it can be matched with any letter.

# For now this program only works with polish language, so it includes all polish letters, 
and does not include V, X and Q.
